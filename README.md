Interface for booking railway tickets on a particular route. The admin has the option of selecting a particular route and the number of seats on the train. Before booking a ticket the user has to enter personal details and codes for the boarding and departure points. If a seat is available for that part of the journey then details of the user are added to a node in the linked list and fare is calculated according to a particular rate and concessions are also provided for senior citizens. User gets an option for confirming the booking and if confirmed a ticket with user details and journey details is printed.

If all the seats on the train are already booked , user details are stored in queue(waiting list) and if cancellations of booked tickets occur , based on the availability of tickets and journey details of the users in queue , the first user encountered  which satisfies the availability conditions has its ticket confirmed automatically. The user can also track real time status of its booking. 

Seat chart and waiting list (accessible only to the admin) can also be displayed.
